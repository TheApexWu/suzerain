# === PARSER CONFIGURATION ===

parser:
  # Minimum fuzzy match score (0-100). Higher = stricter matching.
  # 70 is permissive (good for noisy environments)
  # 80 is balanced (some tolerance for speech variation)
  # 90+ is strict (near-exact required)
  threshold: 80

  # Scoring algorithm. Options:
  # - token_set_ratio: Very permissive, single words can match (DANGEROUS)
  # - partial_ratio: Moderate, best substring match
  # - ratio: Strict, character-by-character comparison
  #
  # Using ratio: strictest, requires near-complete phrase match
  scorer: ratio

  # Ignore case when matching
  case_sensitive: false

  # Words to strip before matching (um, uh, like, etc.)
  strip_filler_words:
    - um
    - uh
