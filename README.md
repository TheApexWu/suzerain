## The Question

You use AI coding tools every day. But *how* do you govern them?

- Do you approve every action, or trust the machine?
- Do you intervene constantly, or let it run?
- Do you follow rigid rules, or adapt on the fly?

Suzerain reveals your governance pattern and maps it to historical archetypes:

| Archetype | Pattern | Historical Parallel |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Autocrat** | Approve everything manually | Roman Emperor — effective but fragile |
| **Council** | Context-dependent trust | Venetian Republic — lasted 1000 years |
| **Deliberator** | Slow, thoughtful, high correction | Athenian Assembly — thorough but slow |
| **Delegator** | Fast, autonomous, full trust | Mongol yasa — speed over safety |
| **Constitutionalist** | Rules-based, predictable | Constitutional systems — stable but rigid |
| **Strategist** | Control the what, delegate the how | Napoleon — leverage through focus |

Learn from civilizations that tried your approach. See what worked. See what collapsed.

│   Weaknesses for your context:                          │
│   ⚠️ Bottleneck — nothing scales beyond your attention  │
│   ⚠️ Burnout risk — cognitive load unsustainable        │

│   Try instead: STRATEGIST                               │
│   → Control architecture decisions, delegate impl       │

## Features

- **Behavior Analysis** — Track how you use Claude Code / Cursor
- **Historical Mapping** — Your patterns → governance archetypes
- **Strengths & Weaknesses** — What works, what doesn't
- **Recommendations** — Alternative styles to try
- **Interactive** — Explore, compare, share your results

## Why This Exists

Most AI tools ask: "How should AI behave?"

Suzerain asks: "How do YOU behave with AI?"

The insight isn't in the tool. It's in understanding yourself.

## The Name

**Suzerain** (n.): A feudal overlord. One who holds sovereignty.

You are the suzerain of your AI tools. But what kind of ruler are you?

*"The truth about the world is that anything is possible."*
*"Now understand how you're choosing to govern that possibility."*
