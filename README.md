# Suzerain

> *"Whatever exists without my knowledge exists without my consent."*

**What kind of AI ruler are you?**

---

## The Idea

You use AI coding tools every day. But how do you govern them?

Suzerain analyzes your behavior and maps it to historical governance styles:

- **Roman Emperor** — You approve everything. Efficient, but you're the bottleneck.
- **Venetian Republic** — Distributed trust with checks and balances.
- **Athenian Democracy** — Transparent, deliberative, everyone debates.
- **Mongol Horde** — Fast and autonomous. Trust your generals.
- **Constitutional Monarchy** — Rules-based with limited autonomy.

Understand your patterns. Learn from 10,000 years of governance experiments.

## How It Works

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   Your Governance Style: ROMAN EMPEROR                  │
│                                                         │
│   You approved 94% of actions manually.                 │
│   Intervention rate: High                               │
│   Trust delegation: Low                                 │
│                                                         │
│   Strengths: Control, consistency, quality              │
│   Weaknesses: Bottleneck, doesn't scale, burnout        │
│                                                         │
│   Historical parallel: Marcus Aurelius                  │
│   What happened: Empire too dependent on one person     │
│                                                         │
│   Try instead: Venetian Republic                        │
│   → Distribute trust across specialized domains         │
│                                                         │

## Why This Exists

Most AI tools ask: "How should AI behave?"

Suzerain asks: "How do YOU behave with AI?"

The insight isn't in the tool. It's in understanding yourself.

## The Name

**Suzerain** (n.): A feudal overlord. One who holds sovereignty.

You are the suzerain of your AI tools. But what kind of ruler are you?
