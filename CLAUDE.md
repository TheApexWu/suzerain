# Suzerain

> *"Whatever exists without my knowledge exists without my consent."*
> Now you'll understand HOW you consent — through the lens of 10,000 years of governance.

**Understand your AI governance style through historical parallels.**

## THE FINAL PIVOT (January 2025)

After 5+ pivots, this is the destination:

| What Suzerain Was | What Suzerain IS |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Voice wrapper | Behavioral analysis |
| YAML config | Historical framework |
| CLI tool | Interactive web app |
| Another wrapper | Unique lens on AI usage |

**The product:** Track how you use AI coding tools. Reveal your governance patterns. Map them to historical civilizations. Teach you to be your own suzerain.

## Core Concept

**Input:** How you use Claude Code / Cursor / AI coding tools
- Approval rate (how often you confirm vs auto-execute)
- Intervention patterns (when do you say "stop"?)
- Trust delegation (what do you let AI do freely?)
- Correction frequency (how often do you undo/redo?)

**Analysis:** Map behavior to governance archetypes
- Roman Emperor (centralized, you approve everything)
- Venetian Republic (councils, checks and balances)
- Athenian Democracy (transparent, deliberative)
- Mongol Horde (fast, autonomous, trust the generals)
- Constitutional Monarchy (rules-based, limited autonomy)

**Output:** Self-knowledge + historical wisdom
- Your strengths and weaknesses as an AI governor
- Historical parallels and what happened to them
- Alternative styles to experiment with
- Concrete prompting/workflow improvements

## Why This Is Different

| Wrappers | Suzerain |
|----------|----------|
| Add a layer on top | Reveal patterns underneath |
| Configure behavior | Understand behavior |
| Yet another tool | A lens, a framework |
| Competes with Anthropic | Complements everything |

**Unique angle:** Psychohistory + Blood Meridian + linguistics background creates something only this project can offer.

## The Tagline

> **"What kind of AI ruler are you?"**

## Context for Claude

When working on this project:

- **Educational focus**: Every feature teaches the builder a skill
- **Historical rigor**: Governance models must be historically accurate
- **Not a wrapper**: We analyze behavior, we don't wrap tools
- **Visual/interactive**: Static sites and CLIs are not the goal
- **HN-worthy**: Build something people want to share and discuss
- **Unique angle**: History + philosophy + linguistics + ML = only this project

## Previous Pivots (Archived)

1. ~~Voice wrapper for Claude Code~~
2. ~~Literary cipher commands (grimoire)~~
3. ~~Transparency layer~~
4. ~~AI governance hooks (constitution.yaml)~~
5. ~~Governance philosophy presets~~

These are deprecated. The codebase may still contain remnants.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can see their AI governance style
- [ ] Historical parallel is accurate and educational
- [ ] Actionable recommendations for improvement
- [ ] Interactive, not just a report
- [ ] Shareable ("I'm a Roman Emperor, what are you?")
- [ ] Teaches builder ML, visualization, full-stack skills

*"The truth about the world is that anything is possible."*
*"Now understand how you're choosing to govern that possibility."*
