# Stormwatch

> A fictional weather CLI for demonstrating Suzerain voice commands.

## About

Stormwatch is a simple command-line weather tool. It's intentionally minimal
to serve as a demo environment for testing voice-activated development.

## Usage

```bash
python src/weather.py --city "San Francisco"
python src/weather.py --forecast 3
```

## Demo Scenario

Imagine you're a developer working on Stormwatch. You want to:
1. Check the project state
2. Run tests
3. Add a new feature
4. Deploy changes

All via voice commands through Suzerain.
